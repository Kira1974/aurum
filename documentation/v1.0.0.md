This first release provides the **base DDD architecture template** for NestJS, including a clean separation of concerns
across domain, application, infrastructure, and interface layers.

---

## ✨ Added

- Independent **domain layer** with entities, services, and events.
- **Application layer** with DTOs, contracts, and use cases.
- **Infrastructure layer** with persistence and providers.
- **Interface layer** for HTTP and gRPC endpoints, along with controllers to consume and publish events to Kafka..
- Shared utilities (`tokens`, `result`, `events`).
