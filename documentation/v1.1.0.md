## 🚀 Release Notes – v1.1.0

This release introduces improvements in code organization, health check endpoints, and a testing structure for the
microservice, building on top of the DDD NestJS template.

### ✨ Added / Improved

- **Code organization:** Refactored project structure for better maintainability and readability.
- **Health check:** Added health check endpoint to verify the microservice status.
- **Testing structure:** Added initial setup for unit and integration tests across layers.
- **Domain layer:** entities, services, and events.
- **Application layer:** DTOs, contracts, and use cases.
- **Infrastructure layer:** persistence, providers, and Kafka integration.
- **Interface layer:** HTTP and gRPC endpoints, with controllers to consume and publish Kafka events.
- **Shared utilities:** tokens, result, events.
- **Pre-commit hook:** All projects must now include a versioned pre-commit hook under the `githooks/` folder, enforcing
  linting, formatting, and unit tests before any commit is accepted.
- **Environment variables management:** Defined with **dotenv** and validated with **Joi**, ensuring the application
  does not start if required variables are invalid or missing.
